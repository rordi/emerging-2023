\section{Literature Review}
\label{sec:literature}

In this section we inform a background on different types of artificial intelligence, hybrid intelligence, 
design patterns and principles for hybrid intelligent systems, and the competitive advantage arising from
the use of such systems in enterprises.

According to \cite{russel2010} artificial intelligence is the creation of computer programs and algorithms
that allow machines to replicate human cognition and behavior, which includes the capabilities of learning, perception,
reasoning, solving problems, and making decisions. Artificial intelligence can be broadly subdivided into symbolic
and sub-symbolic approaches, see e.g., \cite{eliasmithSymbolicSubsymbolic2006}. Symbolic approaches involve the 
use of explicit symbols and rules to represent knowledge and reason in a way that is easily understood and explainable
by humans, while sub-symbolic approaches aim to learn complex patterns from vast amounts of data using neural networks
\citep{ilkouSymbolicVsSubsymbolic2020}.

Hybrid artificial intelligence refers to systems involving symbolic and sub-symbolic approaches. Hybrid AI systems
can be anywhere from loosely coupled to tightly integrated \citep{garcezNeurosymbolicAI3rd2020}. Loosely coupled
hybrid AI systems typically involve a human, which is also known as \textit{human in the loop} (HITL) computing. Within
tightly integrated hybrid AI approaches, neurosymbolic AI has recently earned a particular research interest as a way to
overcome the limitations of deep learning, such as lack of explainability, susceptibility to adversarial attacks
(data poisoning) and high computational cost \citep{garcezNeurosymbolicAI3rd2020}.

Hybrid intelligence (HI) refers to systems where humans and AI systems work together towards common
goals, augmenting the human intellect and overcoming human limitations and cognitive biases \citep{akataResearchAgendaHybrid2020}.
Such HI systems show the  potential for improving the outcomes of AI systems, hence augmenting rather than replacing
human intelligence \cite[p. 19]{akataResearchAgendaHybrid2020}. HI systems can be represented by a boxology notation with certain
design patterns describing the commonalities of such systems that emerge \citep{harmelenBoxologyDesignPatterns2019,
vanbekkumModularDesignPatterns2021,witschelVisualizationPatternsHybrid2021}. HI has recently received attention from
the leaders in the field: in his presidential address to the AAAI community, 
\cite{kambhampatiChallengesHumanAwareAI2020} demanded that AI researchers build human-aware AI systems that consider the 
human mental model. In particular, AI systems should show the capabilities of explicability (AI agents should show
behavior that is expected by humans) and explainability (AI agents -- if behaving unexpectedly -- should be able to provide
an explanation) \citep{kambhampatiChallengesHumanAwareAI2020}.

\subsection{Design Principles Hybrid Intelligent Systems}

\cite{ostheimerAllianceHumansMachines2021} developed a framework of eight principles for the design of human-in-the-loop (HITL) 
computing. They argue that such hybrid systems achieve higher accuracy and reliability of machine learning algorithms. Using a 
case in the manufacturing industry, they showed that the efficiency of operational processes could be increased by applying an 
algorithm that followed these design principles \citep{ostheimerAllianceHumansMachines2021}.

            \item Principle of client-designer relationship: designers should aim for mutual knowledge exchange with clients to foster the understanding
                    of which aspects of a system are influenced by human or artificial intelligence.
            \item Principle of sustainable design: designers should keep up to date with the latest progress in the field of AI and apply the latest and
                    lasting AI techniques.

\subsection{Types of Hybrid Intelligent Systems}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Expert systems 
    \item Decision support systems
    \item Recommender algorithms with human decision-making
    \item Case-based reason systems
\end{itemize}


\subsection{Foundation Models}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Language Models (LMs)
    \item neural networks trained of vast amounts of data, including on multimodal data (text, images, speech, video)
    \item Good at a variety of tasks, often the performance of LMs is closed to that of specialized model
    \item However, they show several limitations in their capabilities in reasoning and information retrieval. 
    \item Thus the terms "Foundation Model" was proposed by researchers at the Human-centered AI (HAI) institute of Stanford University
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Foundation models represent a paradigm shift in AI
    \item ChatGPT as a chatbot is highly interactive: user has to prompt AI (althoug it is an unexplainable black box)
    \item Emerging capability in foundation models: in-context learning 
    \item In-context learning is highly adaptable: AI can learn from examples in the prompt 
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Limitations of Foundation Models}

\subsubsection{Hybrid Intelligent Approaches Involving Foundation Models}

    \item Mixed architecture, e.g., MRKL
    \item Using the model as IR agent

\subsection{Enterprise Competitiveness}

{\color{purple} @todo: what are the aspects of and factors increasing the competitiveness of enterprises?}


\subsection{Competitive Advantage Through Adaptive Hybrid Intelligent Systems}

\cite{xuCanArtificialIntelligence2021} found that post COVID-19 companies using AI in their products grew
faster than their peers. However, they could not observe evidence of the same effect before COVID-19, indicating
that this development is either very recent or was fueled by the COVID crisis. More recently
\cite{hoArtificialIntelligenceFirm2022} reviewed the potential benefits of AI for enterprises as reported
by selected previous studies published between 2016 and 2021:

\begin{itemize}
    \item reduced costs
    \item improved performance
    \item better decision-making
    \item higher customer satisfaction
    \item better customer segmentation
    \item improved customer experience
    \item better products \& services
    \item business innovation
\end{itemize}

Further, \cite{hoArtificialIntelligenceFirm2022} identified several empirical studies that reported a positive,
neutral or negative effect of AI on enterprise performance. In particular one study by ...liu et al. (2022)...
and cited in \cite{hoArtificialIntelligenceFirm2022} reported negative performance of AI-related adoption 
announcements on firm market value for 62 listed US companies between 2015-2019.
