\subsection{Hypotheses}

Hypotheses from the literature:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textit{"[Humans] overestimate the range of expertise of an automated system and deploy it for tasks at which it is not competent"} \citep[p. 19]{akataResearchAgendaHybrid2020}
    \item \textit{"AI systems [...] were not designed with societal values such as fairness, accountability, and transparency in mind"} \citep[p. 19]{akataResearchAgendaHybrid2020}
\end{itemize}



\subsection{Typical Editorial Process}

The typical editorial process for a manuscript submitted to a scholarly journal looks like the following:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Author makes sure the manuscript format meets the journal's guidelines.
    \item Author submits manuscript via online submission system.
    \item Editor receives submission.
    \item Editor conducts desk review.
    \item Editor searches for potential reviewers.
    \item Editor invited potential reviewers.
    \item Reviewer reads the manuscript.
    \item Reviewer writes review report.
    \item Editor reads all review reports.
    \item Editor makes decision.
    
\end{itemize}

            S06 & Editor & Desk reviews the manuscript & Decision support system with AI-assisted checks of the manuscript,
                including detecting plagiarism, tortured phrases ("paraphrased plagiarism"), biased or inappropriate language,
                off-topic references, fabricated or manipulated images, potentially inappropriate authorship, controversial
                topics, etc. Manuscripts are flagged by problem type, ideally by providing examples from within the manuscript,
                for the editor to investigate.\\
