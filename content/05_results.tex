\subsection{Hypotheses}

Hypotheses from the literature:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textit{"[Humans] overestimate the range of expertise of an automated system and deploy it for tasks at which it is not competent"} \citep[p. 19]{akataResearchAgendaHybrid2020}
    \item \textit{"AI systems [...] were not designed with societal values such as fairness, accountability, and transparency in mind"} \citep[p. 19]{akataResearchAgendaHybrid2020}
\end{itemize}



\subsection{Typical Editorial Process}

The typical editorial process for a manuscript submitted to a scholarly journal looks like the following:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Reviewer reads the manuscript.
    \item Editor makes decision.
\end{itemize}


\subsection{Potential Use Cases For (Hybrid) AI in the Editorial Process}

A simplified, typical editorial process -- from writing to the final decision -- for a manuscript submitted to a scholarly journal is shown in
Figure ~\ref{fig:bpmnEditorialProcess}. The process includes at least three parties: the author who writes the manuscript, the editor of the
journal or conference chair that coordinates the peer-review process, and the peer-reviewers that review and comment on a manuscript. Towards
the end of the writing process, the author will start to think about the journal (or conference) where he/she wants to submit the paper to.
Once the author identified a journal, the manuscript has to be formatted to meet the submission requirements of the journal. 

Table  ~\ref{tab:editorialProcess} shows an overview of the use cases for hybrid AI systems for each step in the typical editorial process.

{\color{purple} @todo: then we can pick those areas where adaptive hybrid AI could be interesting and reason why so\dots}

{\color{purple} @todo: then we can pick exactly one adaptive hybrid AI use case, draw 1-2 hypotheses that we can research 
during the workshop\dots}
