The results show that adaptive hybrid AI's contribution to competitive advantage is very pragmatic: the role of such systems 
is to reduce costs by reducing workloads, or by increasing efficiency by avoiding wrong allocation of resources. In some cases 
adaptive hybrid AI systems could help to improve product quality or customer experience. However, the findings suggest that 
the contribution of adaptive hybrid AI to competitive advantage is limited to incremental improvements. In two cases
innovations based on an adaptive, hybrid AI may lead to increased revenues. Firstly, in desk review, we found that a system which
effectively distinguishes papers that are likely to be accepted may also contribute to increased revenues. Secondly, one group 
of participants suggested that certain quality and background checks could be offered as paid-for add-on services.
Of course the findings are limited by the fact that we decomposed the editorial process in steps and investigated use cases
for each step. Thus, the ideas and scenarios that were developed represent incremental improvements and will not lead to 
transformative business models with the potential to disrupt the industry.
